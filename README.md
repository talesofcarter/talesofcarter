# Hello👋 My name is Kelvin, and I am a Front-end Developer.

I draw inspiration from the art of coffee brewing - it's simplicity and attention to detail aligns with my passion for creating web experiences (UX). Just as each cup tells a story, I create high-quality digital products with a lasting impression. 💡

- I’m currently working on **front-end projects**
- I’m currently learning **React and Python**
- I’m looking to collaborate with a **Seasoned Full Stack Developer**
- Fun fact: **Gaming and WWE fanatic**
